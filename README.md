Kerbal commands for your AR.Drone
=================================


Connect to your drone, then:
```
node keyboard.js
```

And open `localhost:3000/index.html`.  Click somewhere on the screen so it grabs keyboard inputs.
[Controls](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_Bindings) are like in 
[Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/), with some missing keys/altered meanings:

* `shift` to increase thursters! (climb up)
* `command` to decrease thrusters! (climb down)
* `spacebar` to takeoff/land
* `t` to stabilize.
* `w` to pitch forward.
* `s` to picth backward.
* `a` to yaw counter-clockwise (left).
* `d` to yaw clockwise (right).
* `q` to roll counter-clockwise (left).
* `d` to roll clockwise (right).

That's it!

The red squared canvas let's you draw shapes (with no visual feedback whatsoever ^^!) and 
will 'roughly' reproduce them with the drone.

Have fun!
